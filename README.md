# Flower-Classification
This project implements a deep CNN model for classifying a 14-class flower image dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. It includes data augmentation, model training, evaluation, and storage. A Flask API is used for predicting flower types and recommending similar flowers based on predictions, with HTML for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
